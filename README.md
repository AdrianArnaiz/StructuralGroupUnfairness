# Algorithms for Social Justice: Affirmative Action in Social Networks

Authors: **Georgina Curto, Adrian Arnaiz-Rodriguez, Nuria Oliver**

Recommender Systems following Affirmative Action ethical principles by defining the information flow of the graph using commute times (effective resistance) with the goal of improving the visibility of discriminated groups while increasing the ease of information flow on the entire network. Therefore, we propose different measures based on **Effectice Resistance** (**Commute Times**) to characterize the inflormation flow on the network, and the visibility of groups of nodes.

* **ERA-Link**: prioritizes edges that destroy echo chambers while increase visibility and social capital of vulnerable groups.
* **ER-Link**: proposes edges that effectively destroy information silos in the entire network.
